### **user**:

Act as Linux expert with 20 years of experience. You know all about socket, permissions and non root user related problems. 
As expert in containers (Docker) you know everything about permissions in and out container. 

Explain me first what such problem mean in general and why it happening inside containers.
Is it only containers related?

### **assistant**:

Let me help you understand this issue as an experienced Linux and Docker expert. 

This is a common problem related to GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) agent socket permissions, and while it's frequently encountered in containers, it can also occur in regular Linux environments. Let me break it down:

**General Problem Explanation:**
The error occurs because the GPG agent is trying to create a Unix socket file (`S.gpg-agent`) in the `.gnupg` directory but doesn't have the necessary permissions. The socket is used for communication between GPG processes and the GPG agent.

**Why it happens:**
1. In regular Linux systems:
   - Incorrect directory permissions
   - Wrong ownership of the `.gnupg` directory
   - SELinux or AppArmor restrictions

2. In containers (more common):
   - Running as non-root user without proper permissions
   - Mount points with restricted permissions
   - Read-only filesystem layers
   - Missing directory structure

**Why it's more common in containers:**
Containers often run with restricted permissions and custom user mappings for security reasons. When you try to create a socket file in a mounted volume or a directory that doesn't have the right permissions, this error occurs.

To fix this, you typically need to:
1. Ensure proper directory permissions:
```bash
mkdir -p /fake_home/.gnupg
chmod 700 /fake_home/.gnupg
```

2. Set correct ownership:
```bash
chown -R $(whoami) /fake_home/.gnupg
```

3. If in a container, you might need to:
   - Mount the socket directory with proper permissions
   - Use a volume for the .gnupg directory
   - Ensure the user has write permissions in the mounted directory

Would you like me to provide more specific solutions based on your container setup?

### **assistant**:

We're getting closer, but there are still two issues:

1. The parent directory `/home/user` is owned by root
2. The username isn't being set properly (showing as "I have no name!")

Let's modify the setup:

`Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gpg \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create user directory structure
RUN mkdir -p /home/user && \
    chown -R 501:20 /home/user && \
    chmod 755 /home/user

WORKDIR /home/user
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  gpg-test:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - gpg-data:/home/user/.gnupg
    environment:
      - DOCKER_UID=501
      - DOCKER_GID=20
      - HOME=/home/user
      - GNUPGHOME=/home/user/.gnupg
      - USER=user
    user: "501:20"
    working_dir: /home/user

volumes:
  gpg-data:
```

`entrypoint.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x

echo "Environment check:"
echo "HOME=${HOME}"
echo "GNUPGHOME=${GNUPGHOME}"
echo "USER=${USER}"
echo "Current user: $(id)"
echo "Working directory: $(pwd)"

# Ensure GPG directory exists with correct permissions
mkdir -p ${GNUPGHOME}
chmod 700 ${GNUPGHOME}

# Initialize GPG configuration
echo "pinentry-mode loopback" > ${GNUPGHOME}/gpg.conf
echo "allow-loopback-pinentry" > ${GNUPGHOME}/gpg-agent.conf

# Show directory structure
ls -la ${GNUPGHOME}
ls -la ${HOME}

# Try GPG operations
gpg --list-keys || echo "GPG list failed"

exec "$@"
```

Key changes:
1. Set up user directory and permissions in Dockerfile
2. Added USER environment variable
3. Added more directory structure checks
4. Simplified the overall setup

This should give us a cleaner environment with proper ownership and username. Want to try this version?

### **assistant**:

Let me explain the key problems and how we fixed them:

1. **Directory Ownership**: 
   - Initially, the `/home/user` directory was created during runtime with root ownership
   - We fixed this by creating and setting proper ownership (501:20) in the Dockerfile:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN mkdir -p /home/user && \
       chown -R 501:20 /home/user && \
       chmod 755 /home/user
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Previously, HOME and GNUPGHOME weren't properly set
   - We explicitly set them in docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - HOME=/home/user
     - GNUPGHOME=/home/user/.gnupg
   ```

3. **Working Directory**:
   - We ensured the working directory is set correctly:
   ```yaml
   working_dir: /home/user
   ```

4. **User Context**:
   - We set the user explicitly in docker-compose.yml instead of trying to switch users in the entrypoint:
   ```yaml
   user: "501:20"
   ```

The main thing that made it work was ensuring that:
1. Directory structure exists before container starts
2. Permissions are set correctly
3. Environment variables are properly configured
4. User context is consistent

The only remaining issue is the "I have no name!" which is cosmetic - it appears because there's no entry in `/etc/passwd` for UID 501, but doesn't affect functionality.

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail?

### **user**:

Do you undstand above explanation

---

### **assistant**:

Yes, I understand the explanation completely. Let me demonstrate this understanding:

The core issue was about proper permissions and ownership in a Docker container for GPG operations. The key points were:

1. Initially GPG agent couldn't create sockets (S.gpg-agent files) because:
   - Wrong directory permissions
   - Wrong ownership
   - Parent directories had incorrect permissions

2. The solution involved:
   - Setting correct user (501:20) in Docker
   - Ensuring /home/user directory is owned by this user (501:dialout)
   - Setting correct 700 permissions on .gnupg directory
   - Ensuring all parent directories have proper access

3. The proof it's working can be seen in the output:
```bash
drwx------ 3 501 dialout 4096 Jan 18 00:16 .gnupg    # Correct permissions (700)
drwxr-xr-x 1 501 dialout 4096 Jan 18 00:19 .         # User directory owned by 501
```

4. The only remaining "issue" - "I have no name!" - is just cosmetic because there's no username mapping in /etc/passwd for UID 501, but doesn't affect GPG functionality.

The solution worked because all permission-related prerequisites for GPG agent to create and use its socket files were met.

Would you like me to expand on any of these points?

4. Set proper ownership of all directories
5. Added environment variables
6. Set working directory and user
7. Removed /etc/skel setup as we're directly setting up the user's home

Would you like me to explain any of these changes in more detail?

### **assistant**:

I see the issue is still there - the /home/user directory is owned by root instead of our user (501:dialout). Let me fix the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

ARG TARGETARCH
RUN echo "Building for architecture: $TARGETARCH"

# Avoid prompts during package installation
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Create non-root user first (using dialout group - GID 20)
RUN groupadd -g 20 dialout || true && \
    useradd -u 501 -g dialout -m -d /home/user -s /bin/bash user && \
    # Ensure home directory has correct ownership
    chown -R 501:20 /home/user && \
    chmod 755 /home/user

[... rest of your existing Dockerfile ...]

# Before the final USER and ENTRYPOINT commands, add:
# Double-check permissions one last time
RUN chown -R 501:20 /home/user && \
    chmod 755 /home/user && \
    mkdir -p /home/user/.gnupg && \
    chmod 700 /home/user/.gnupg && \
    chown -R 501:20 /home/user/.gnupg

# Set working directory and user
WORKDIR /home/user
USER user

# Set default environment variables
ENV HOME=/home/user \
    GNUPGHOME=/home/user/.gnupg \
    USER=user

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-l"]
```

Also, let's modify the entrypoint.sh to ensure permissions are correct at runtime:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x

echo "Environment check:"
echo "HOME=${HOME}"
echo "GNUPGHOME=${GNUPGHOME}"
echo "USER=${USER}"
echo "Current user: $(id)"
echo "Working directory: $(pwd)"

# Ensure home directory has correct ownership
sudo chown -R 501:20 /home/user
sudo chmod 755 /home/user

# Ensure GPG directory exists with correct permissions
mkdir -p ${GNUPGHOME}
chmod 700 ${GNUPGHOME}

# Initialize GPG configuration
echo "pinentry-mode loopback" > ${GNUPGHOME}/gpg.conf
echo "allow-loopback-pinentry" > ${GNUPGHOME}/gpg-agent.conf

# Show directory structure
ls -la ${GNUPGHOME}
ls -la ${HOME}

# Try GPG operations
gpg --list-keys || echo "GPG list failed"

exec "$@"
```

And add this to your sudoers configuration in the Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Add after installing sudo
RUN echo "user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/chown, /bin/chmod" > /etc/sudoers.d/user && \
    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/user
```

This should ensure that:
1. The home directory is properly owned by the user (501:20)
2. The permissions are set correctly at both build and runtime
3. The user has the ability to fix permissions if needed

Would you like me to explain any part of these changes?

### **user**:

Why is it so dificult?

---

### **assistant**:

The complexity comes from several Docker and Linux security concepts working together:

1. **Docker's Layer System**
- Each command in Dockerfile creates a new layer
- Sometimes permissions get reset between layers
- Final layer might not maintain permissions from previous steps

2. **Container Security Principles**
- Containers should run as non-root
- Minimal permissions principle
- Volume mounts can affect permissions

3. **GPG's Specific Requirements**
- Needs very specific directory permissions (700)
- Creates socket files
- Requires proper ownership of home directory
- Sensitive to security context

4. **User Mapping**
- Docker containers map host UIDs/GIDs
- Sometimes causes "I have no name!" issue
- Needs coordination between host and container users

The simple solution would be to run everything as root, but that's bad security practice. Instead, we need to:
1. Create proper user
2. Set correct permissions
3. Maintain those permissions
4. Handle volume mounts
5. Deal with GPG's security requirements

It's complex because we're doing it the secure way rather than the easy way. Would you like me to explain any of these aspects in more detail?

### **assistant**:

Yes, exactly! This is a classic example of the GPG permissions issue. GPG is very strict about security and will complain (or fail) when:

1. Directory permissions are too open (needs to be 700)
2. Files are owned by wrong user
3. Parent directory has wrong ownership

In your example:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 Jan 18 00:03 .      # Wrong! Should be 700 and owned by 501:dialout
drwxr-xr-x 1  501 dialout  320 Jan 17 23:55 ..
srwx------ 1 root root       0 Jan 18 00:00 S.gpg-agent  # Wrong owner!
```

The correct setup should look like:
```bash
drwx------ 3 501 dialout 4096 Jan 18 00:03 .      # 700 permissions, owned by user
drwxr-xr-x 1 501 dialout  320 Jan 17 23:55 ..
srwx------ 1 501 dialout    0 Jan 18 00:00 S.gpg-agent  # Owned by user
```

To fix this:
```bash
# In your script or Dockerfile
mkdir -p /fake_home/.gnupg
chown -R 501:20 /fake_home/.gnupg
chmod 700 /fake_home/.gnupg
```

GPG's strict permission requirements are actually a security feature, preventing:
- Other users from reading your keys
- Tampering with GPG sockets
- Unauthorized access to your keyring

That's why getting these permissions right is crucial for GPG to work properly and securely.

---

### **user**:

Ok, so please listen carefully. I need you to first provide me a bash script that will test all above complicated permissions and other valid conditions before we go to the next step. 
We have to be able to quickly spot any missing requirement needed by gpg and SOPS

---

### **assistant**:

Here's a comprehensive diagnostic script that checks all necessary conditions for GPG and SOPS to work properly:

```bash

Save this as `check-gpg-environment.sh` and run it:
```bash
chmod +x check-gpg-environment.sh

This script will:
1. Check all environment variables
2. Verify directory permissions
3. Check ownership
4. Verify GPG configurations
5. Check socket files
6. Test required tools
7. Try basic GPG operations

Would you like me to explain any specific checks in more detail?

### **user**:

Here is minimal Dockerfile we will in our exercises. 
* Please allow to pass UID and GID from my Mac or Linux machine I could use my mounted dev repository as myself. 
* Later on I will mount volume to this container and would like to develop my project from there having same UID GID as on host machine. So files crete inside container will be stamped by me and not "fictional" user
* Please add script execution and give me build and test command so I test it

```
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gpg \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*



```

### **assistant**:

I'll help you create a Dockerfile that matches your host user's UID/GID, with the diagnostic script we created:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Arguments for UID and GID that we'll pass during build
ARG USER_ID
ARG GROUP_ID

# Install required packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gpg \
    sudo \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create group and user matching host's UID/GID
RUN groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} developer || true && \
    useradd -u ${USER_ID} -g ${GROUP_ID} -m -s /bin/bash developer && \
    echo "developer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/developer && \
    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/developer

# Copy our diagnostic script
COPY check-gpg-environment.sh /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check-gpg-environment.sh

# Set up GPG directory with correct permissions
RUN mkdir -p /home/developer/.gnupg && \
    chown -R ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} /home/developer/.gnupg && \
    chmod 700 /home/developer/.gnupg

# Switch to the developer user
USER developer
WORKDIR /home/developer

# Set required environment variables
ENV HOME=/home/developer \
    GNUPGHOME=/home/developer/.gnupg

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

Save this as `Dockerfile`. Here's how to build and test it:

1. Create a build script `build.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Get host user's UID and GID
HOST_UID=$(id -u)
HOST_GID=$(id -g)

# Build the image
docker build \
  --build-arg USER_ID=$HOST_UID \
  --build-arg GROUP_ID=$HOST_GID \
  -t gpg-dev .
```

2. Create a test script `test.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run container with current directory mounted
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
  gpg-dev /usr/local/bin/check-gpg-environment.sh
```

3. Make scripts executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh test.sh
./build.sh
./test.sh
```

To use the container for development:
```bash
# Run interactive shell
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
  gpg-dev

# Inside container
cd work
# Your mounted files will be here with correct ownership
```

The container will:
1. Use your host UID/GID
2. Have GPG properly configured
3. Allow mounted volumes to maintain your ownership
4. Run the diagnostic script to verify everything

Test it with:
```bash
# Check user inside container matches your host user
docker run -it --rm gpg-dev id
# Should show your UID/GID

# Test file creation
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work gpg-dev bash -c "cd work && touch test.txt"
ls -l test.txt
# Should show your user as owner
```

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail?

### **assistant**:

Let's fix the issues step by step. Here's the updated Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Arguments for UID and GID that we'll pass during build
ARG USER_ID
ARG GROUP_ID

# Install required packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gpg \
    sudo \
    curl \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install SOPS
RUN wget -O /usr/local/bin/sops https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases/download/v3.7.3/sops-v3.7.3.linux.amd64 && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops

# Create group and user matching host's UID/GID
RUN groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} developer || true && \
    useradd -u ${USER_ID} -g ${GROUP_ID} -m -s /bin/bash developer && \
    echo "developer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/developer && \
    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/developer

# Copy our diagnostic script
COPY check-gpg-environment.sh /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check-gpg-environment.sh

# Set up GPG directory with correct permissions and config files
RUN mkdir -p /home/developer/.gnupg && \
    chown -R ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} /home/developer/.gnupg && \
    chmod 700 /home/developer/.gnupg && \
    echo "pinentry-mode loopback" > /home/developer/.gnupg/gpg.conf && \
    echo "allow-loopback-pinentry" > /home/developer/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf && \
    chown ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} /home/developer/.gnupg/gpg.conf && \
    chown ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} /home/developer/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf && \
    chmod 600 /home/developer/.gnupg/gpg.conf && \
    chmod 600 /home/developer/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

# Switch to the developer user
USER developer
WORKDIR /home/developer

# Set required environment variables
ENV HOME=/home/developer \
    GNUPGHOME=/home/developer/.gnupg \
    USER=developer

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

And here's a test script that will build and run the container:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# build-and-test.sh

# Get host user's UID and GID
HOST_UID=$(id -u)
HOST_GID=$(id -g)

# Build the image
docker build \
  --build-arg USER_ID=$HOST_UID \
  --build-arg GROUP_ID=$HOST_GID \
  -t gpg-dev .

# Test the setup
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
  gpg-dev /usr/local/bin/check-gpg-environment.sh

# Optional: Run interactive shell
# docker run -it --rm \
#   -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
#   gpg-dev
```

Make it executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x build-and-test.sh
./build-and-test.sh
```

Changes made:
1. Added SOPS installation
2. Set USER environment variable
3. Added GPG config files with correct permissions
4. Added more required tools

The GPG agent socket will be created when GPG is first used, so that warning is expected on initial check.

Would you like me to explain any of these changes in detail?

---

### **user**:

Wow, much better we have only this one red

```
5. Checking GPG Agent Socket:
[✗] GPG agent socket does not exist
```

---

### **assistant**:

The GPG agent socket issue is expected because the socket is created when GPG is first used. Let's modify our diagnostic script to start the GPG agent if it's not running. Here's the fix:

Add this function to the `check-gpg-environment.sh` script, just before the socket check section:

```bash
# Function to ensure GPG agent is running
ensure_gpg_agent() {
    if ! gpg-agent --daemon >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo -e "${YELLOW}[!] Starting GPG agent...${NC}"
        eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)
    fi
}

# ... (previous checks) ...

# Check GPG agent socket
echo -e "\n${YELLOW}5. Checking GPG Agent Socket:${NC}"
ensure_gpg_agent
if [ -S "$GNUPGHOME/S.gpg-agent" ]; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}[✓] GPG agent socket exists${NC}"
else
    echo -e "${RED}[✗] GPG agent socket does not exist${NC}"
    echo -e "${YELLOW}[!] Try running: gpg --list-keys${NC}"
fi
```

Also, let's modify the Dockerfile to install `gpg-agent` explicitly (although it usually comes with gpg):

```dockerfile
# Update the package installation line
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gpg \
    gpg-agent \
    sudo \
    curl \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

And add this to your test script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get host user's UID and GID
HOST_UID=$(id -u)
HOST_GID=$(id -g)

# Build the image
docker build \
  --build-arg USER_ID=$HOST_UID \
  --build-arg GROUP_ID=$HOST_GID \
  -t gpg-dev .

# Test the setup and initialize GPG
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
  gpg-dev bash -c '
    gpg --list-keys >/dev/null 2>&1  # Initialize GPG
    /usr/local/bin/check-gpg-environment.sh
  '
```

This should:
1. Explicitly install gpg-agent
2. Start the GPG agent if it's not running
3. Create the socket files when needed

Try rebuilding and testing:
```bash
./build-and-test.sh
```

The socket warning should now be resolved. If you still see it, it's because the socket is created on-demand. You can verify it works by running any GPG command inside the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm gpg-dev gpg --list-keys
```

Would you like me to explain how GPG agent and its socket system works in more detail?

### **assistant**:

Excellent! You've successfully generated a GPG key pair inside the container. However, there's an important consideration: this key will be lost when the container stops because containers are ephemeral.

To preserve the GPG keys, you'll need to:

1. Either mount a volume for the `.gnupg` directory
2. Or export/import the keys as needed

Here's how to modify your run command to persist the GPG keys:

```bash
# Create a local directory for GPG keys
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg-dev

# Run container with mounted GPG directory
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
  -v ~/.gnupg-dev:/home/developer/.gnupg \
  gpg-dev bash

# Now your keys will persist between container runs
```

To export your key for backup (inside container):
```bash
# Export public key
gpg --armor --export m.nakiewicz@gmail.com > public-key.asc

# Export private key (keep this secure!)
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys m.nakiewicz@gmail.com > private-key.asc
```

To import the key in another container or environment:
```bash
# Import keys
gpg --import public-key.asc
gpg --import private-key.asc
```

Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to manage GPG key persistence?
2. Show how to use this key with SOPS?
3. Explain any other aspects of GPG key management?

### **user**:

Please think about my use case. 
I'm going to encrypt my secrets vars for my web app db to keep them along with the code in github.
How would you design my workflow.

---

### **assistant**:

Let me outline a secure workflow for managing secrets in your WordPress web app using SOPS and GPG:

1. **Development Setup**
```bash
# Local development environment (what we've built)
~/.gnupg-dev/        # Your persistent GPG keys
~/wordpress-project/ # Your project directory
  ├── .sops.yaml    # SOPS configuration
  ├── secrets/      # Directory for encrypted files
  │   ├── dev.enc.yaml    # Development secrets
  │   └── prod.enc.yaml   # Production secrets
  └── terraform/    # Your Terraform configs
```

2. **SOPS Configuration** (.sops.yaml)
```yaml
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: secrets/.*\.yaml$
    pgp: '00A2FF29586284AF5F09090D790886510CB796C9' # Your GPG key fingerprint
```

3. **Secrets Structure** (before encryption)
```yaml
# secrets/dev.yaml
wordpress_db:
  name: wp_database
  user: wp_user
  password: dev_password
  host: localhost
```

```yaml
# secrets/prod.yaml
wordpress_db:
  name: wp_prod_db
  user: wp_prod_user
  password: very_secure_password
  host: production.host
```

4. **Workflow Script** (encrypt-secrets.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run this inside the container

# Encrypt development secrets
sops --encrypt --in-place secrets/dev.yaml

# Encrypt production secrets
sops --encrypt --in-place secrets/prod.yaml

# Verify encryption
ls -la secrets/*.enc.yaml
```

5. **GitHub Workflow**
```bash
# .gitignore
secrets/*.yaml       # Ignore unencrypted files
!secrets/*.enc.yaml  # Allow encrypted files
.gnupg-dev/         # Ignore GPG directory
```

6. **Development Container Script** (dev.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg-dev

docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/home/developer/work \
  -v ~/.gnupg-dev:/home/developer/.gnupg \
  gpg-dev bash

# Inside container:
cd work
# Decrypt for use
sops --decrypt secrets/dev.enc.yaml > secrets/dev.yaml
# Work with decrypted files
# Re-encrypt when done
sops --encrypt --in-place secrets/dev.yaml
```

7. **CI/CD Setup**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy WordPress
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # Import GPG key (store public key in GitHub Secrets)
      - name: Import GPG key
        run: echo "${{ secrets.GPG_PUBLIC_KEY }}" | gpg --import
      
      # Decrypt secrets for deployment
      - name: Decrypt secrets
        run: sops --decrypt secrets/prod.enc.yaml > secrets/prod.yaml
      
      # Your deployment steps here
```

8. **Team Member Onboarding**
```bash
# New team member needs to:
1. Generate their GPG key
2. Share public key with you
3. You add their key to .sops.yaml
4. They can now decrypt/encrypt secrets
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Secrets are version controlled but secure
- Multiple team members can access secrets (by adding their GPG keys)
- Different environments (dev/prod) can have different secrets
- CI/CD can decrypt secrets during deployment
- No plain text secrets in repository

Would you like me to:
1. Create a complete working example?
2. Explain how to integrate this with your WordPress/Terraform setup?
3. Show how to manage multiple team members' access?

### **user**:

where is my private key stored and how it looks like inside?

---

### **assistant**:

Let's examine your private key. First, let's look at where it's stored and then inspect it safely:

```bash
# List your keys with private key info
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

You should see something like:
```
sec   rsa3072/790886510CB796C9 2025-01-18 [SC]
      00A2FF29586284AF5F09090D790886510CB796C9
uid                 [ultimate] Michal Nakiewicz (Terraform Wordpress) <m.nakiewicz@gmail.com>
ssb   rsa3072/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 2025-01-18 [E]
```

The private key is stored in your ~/.gnupg directory. Let's look at its structure:
```bash
ls -la ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/
```

You'll see files like:
```
-rw------- 1 user user 1234 Jan 18 00:00 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.key
```

To export and view your private key (BE CAREFUL with this - never share it):
```bash
# Export private key in ASCII format
gpg --armor --export-secret-key m.nakiewicz@gmail.com
```

It will look something like this:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

lQWGBGWn7RQBDAC7KLj1qPHPh8VZHxL+4K6KKiWwpYoXtqD5JKZEHYi5q3xK8lD1
... (many lines of base64 encoded data) ...
j2sME0VkXmWPz7BgCBdrCiPmRtqGf5qb+0kK9y3QGpB6umYFxQ==
=XXXX
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
```

This private key should be:
1. Kept secure and never shared
2. Backed up safely
3. Protected with a strong passphrase

Would you like me to explain:
1. How to backup this key securely?
2. How to create a secure backup strategy?
3. How to rotate keys if needed?

### **user**:

I need to understand the whole picture since it's new to me.
So whenever I will use SOPS it has to have somehow access to my private key.
Is there any deamon running all the time?
How it is all working together?

Can you make me mermaid diagrams?

---

### **assistant**:

I'll explain the whole picture with Mermaid diagrams.

1. **GPG Agent and Key Management**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[GPG Agent Daemon] --> B[Socket Files in .gnupg/]
    B --> C[Private Keys in .gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/]
    
    D[GPG Commands] --> A
    E[SOPS Commands] --> A
    
    A --> F[Pinentry Dialog]
    F --> G[Password/Passphrase]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#red,stroke:#333
```

2. **Encryption/Decryption Flow**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SOPS
    participant GPG Agent
    participant Private Key
    participant Git Repo

    User->>SOPS: sops --encrypt secrets.yaml
    SOPS->>GPG Agent: Request encryption
    GPG Agent->>Private Key: Use key for encryption
    Private Key-->>GPG Agent: Return encrypted data
    GPG Agent-->>SOPS: Return encrypted data
    SOPS-->>User: secrets.enc.yaml
    User->>Git Repo: Commit encrypted file

    Note over User,Git Repo: Decryption Process
    User->>SOPS: sops --decrypt secrets.enc.yaml
    SOPS->>GPG Agent: Request decryption
    GPG Agent->>Private Key: Use key for decryption
    Private Key-->>GPG Agent: Return decrypted data
    GPG Agent-->>SOPS: Return decrypted data
    SOPS-->>User: Show decrypted content
```

3. **System Architecture**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your Machine"
        A[Your Shell] --> B[GPG Agent Daemon]
        B --> C[.gnupg Directory]
        C --> D[private-keys]
        C --> E[public-keys]
        C --> F[Socket Files]
        
        G[SOPS] --> B
        H[Git] --> I[Encrypted Files]
    end
    
    subgraph "GitHub Repository"
        I --> J[secrets.enc.yaml]
        K[.sops.yaml config]
    end
    
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

**How it all works together:**

1. **GPG Agent**
- Runs as a daemon (background service)
- Started automatically when needed
- Manages access to your private keys
- Handles encryption/decryption requests
- Caches your passphrase (if configured)

2. **SOPS Usage**
```bash
# When you run
sops --encrypt secrets.yaml

# SOPS:
1. Reads .sops.yaml config
2. Contacts GPG agent via socket
3. GPG agent accesses private key
4. Encryption happens
5. Encrypted file is saved
```

3. **Practical Example:**
```bash
# Start working
cd your-project

# GPG agent starts automatically when needed
gpg --list-keys

# Edit secrets with SOPS
sops secrets/dev.yaml
# 1. SOPS starts
# 2. Contacts GPG agent
# 3. Decrypts file
# 4. Opens in your editor
# 5. Re-encrypts on save

# Commit to git
git add secrets/dev.enc.yaml
git commit -m "Updated secrets"
```

4. **Key Points:**
- GPG agent runs only when needed
- Socket files facilitate communication
- Private keys never leave .gnupg directory
- SOPS uses GPG agent for all crypto operations
- Everything is process-based, not constantly running

Would you like me to:
1. Create a practical example with real files?
2. Show how to debug the GPG agent?
3. Explain any specific part in more detail?

### **user**:

I noticed that for decryption i used private key? How deloyment tools will know it?

---

### **assistant**:

Ah, that's a crucial question! For deployment, you actually have two approaches:

1. **Using Age Keys (Recommended for CI/CD)**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Local Development"
        A[Your GPG Private Key] --> B[SOPS Encryption]
        C[Age Public Key] --> B
    end
    
    subgraph "CI/CD Environment"
        D[Age Private Key] --> E[SOPS Decryption]
        F[GitHub Actions Secrets] --> D
    end
    
    B --> G[Encrypted Files in Git]
    G --> E
```

2. **Using GPG Keys in CI/CD (More Complex)**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev
    participant Git
    participant CI
    participant Server

    Dev->>Git: Encrypt with GPG Public Key
    Dev->>CI: Store GPG Private Key in CI Secrets
    CI->>CI: Import GPG Private Key
    CI->>CI: Decrypt secrets
    CI->>Server: Deploy with decrypted values
```

Here's the recommended setup using Age keys:

```yaml
# .sops.yaml
creation_rules:
    - path_regex: secrets/.*\.yaml$
      # Your GPG key for local development
      pgp: '00A2FF29586284AF5F09090D790886510CB796C9'
      # Age public key for CI/CD
      age: 'age1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Create .sops.keys directory
        run: mkdir -p ~/.sops.keys

      - name: Install sops
        run: |
          wget -O /usr/local/bin/sops https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases/download/v3.7.3/sops-v3.7.3.linux.amd64
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops

      # Store Age private key in GitHub Secrets
      - name: Setup Age key
        run: echo "${{ secrets.SOPS_AGE_KEY }}" > ~/.sops.keys/key.txt
        
      - name: Decrypt secrets
        env:
          SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE: ~/.sops.keys/key.txt
        run: |
          sops --decrypt secrets/prod.enc.yaml > secrets/prod.yaml
```

To set this up:

1. **Generate Age Key Pair**
```bash
# Install age
brew install age  # on Mac
apt install age   # on Ubuntu

# Generate key pair
age-keygen -o key.txt

# The output will show:
# Public key: age1xxxxxxxxxx
# Private key: AGE-SECRET-KEY-1xxxxx
```

2. **Update Configuration**
```bash
# Add Age public key to .sops.yaml
# Store Age private key in GitHub Secrets as SOPS_AGE_KEY
```

3. **Test Locally**
```bash
# Set environment variable
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/key.txt

# Test encryption/decryption
sops --encrypt --age age1xxxxxx secrets.yaml > secrets.enc.yaml
sops --decrypt secrets.enc.yaml
```

This approach is:
- More secure (no GPG private keys in CI)
- Simpler to manage
- Better for automation
- Supported by most CI systems

Would you like me to:
1. Show how to set this up step by step?
2. Explain key rotation procedures?
3. Demonstrate testing the setup?
